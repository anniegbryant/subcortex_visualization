All code can be found in the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anniegbryant/subcortex_visualization).

More information about these atlases, including the process of rendering the surfaces and tracing the outlines for each, can be found in the [Atlas information](https://anniegbryant.github.io/subcortex_visualization/atlas_info/) directory.
